# A Survey of Mixed Precision Multigrid Methods

This repository is for storing my report and presentation slides for the seminar course Modern Trends in High Performance Computing at the University of Munich, where I did a literature research regarding mixed precision multigrid methods. Apart from that, some experiments about matrix multiplication were also conducted as a requirement of the course.
